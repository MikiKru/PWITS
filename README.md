Climate change adaptation and mitigation, and industry 4.0 are two important challenges that countries worldwide are facing. The integration of climate change and forth industry revolution could bring several benefits related to promoting sustainability and global economic decarbonization. During the workshop we will conduct an analysis to describe the main principles and basic technologies of fourth industry revolution, link it to climate change and identify the conditions which would make industry 4.0 climate compatible. The interactive workshop concerns an implementation of selected machine learning and data mining techniques on real-world datasets. The workshop is intended for beginners in programming interested in data science techniques.
